## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter where Silvain and Émile encounter a 'living echo'—a person or creature formed entirely from a potent, collective memory of a place that was almost real.
- Create a journal entry from a long-dead Luminaire cartographer, describing the moment they first successfully mapped a 'mythopoetic layer' and the personal cost it incurred.
- Draft a scene set in the 'unwritten city' of white stone from Émile's dreams, from the perspective of the woman in the green dress waiting by the fountain.
- Write a monologue for Madame Thérèse explaining her backstory: how a simple *libraire* became a dealer in narratives and a gatekeeper for those touched by echoes.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive 'Echo Map' visualization where users can explore different 'mythopoetic layers' of Paris, with each layer representing a potent but unrealized past (e.g., a Paris that remained Roman, a Paris built entirely of crystal, etc.).
- Design a generative text tool that simulates 'echo leakage': it takes a seed description of a real place and gradually infuses it with elements from a user-defined 'potential past,' blending the two narratives.
